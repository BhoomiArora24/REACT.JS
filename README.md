# 🚀 ReactJS Learning Projects (Inspired by Chai aur Code)

This repository contains my **ReactJS practice projects** from the “Chai aur Code” series by Hitesh Chaudhary. I’m following along and building each mini project to learn React’s fundamentals, hooks, state management, and routing.

## 🎯 What’s Included

I’ve worked on the following projects so far—each one helps me grow as a React developer:

| Project Folder                       | Description                                   |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `01_basic_react`                   | React setup & basic component rendering       |
| `02_counter`                       | Simple counter using `useState`               |
| `03_tailwind_props`               | Using Tailwind CSS and passing props          |
| `04_bgChanger`                     | Background color changer using events         |
| `05_password-generator`            | Generating random passwords with logic        |
| `06_currency_converter`            | Live currency conversion with custom hooks    |
| `07_react_router`                  | Basic routing with React Router               |
| `08_mini_context`                  | Small example using Context API               |
| `09_theme_switcher`                | Dark/light theme toggle using Context         |
| `10_todoapp_localstorage`          | To-do app with persistence in `localStorage`  |

*More projects from the series will be added, from context API and hooks to routing and state management with Redux Toolkit.*

## 🛠 Tech Being Used

- **ReactJS** (functional components, React Router, Context API)
- **Hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect`, custom hooks (`useContext`, etc.)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS / basic CSS
- **Persistence**: `localStorage` (for To-Do app, etc.)

## 📈 Why This Repo Matters

- I’m learning React step-by-step—building each template/project myself.
- Solidifying understanding of component hierarchy, props, hooks, and state logic.
- Practicing clean, modular, and reusable code that can later become portfolio work.

## ✅ How to Run Projects

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-learning-projects.git
   cd react-learning-projects
2. Navigate to a project folder (e.g., cd 02_counter)

Install dependencies and run:

npm install  
<br/>
npm start
